How to come out of 35L debt in the form of personal loans which I lost in trading.,"Please help me! 

I am a software professional earning over 1.3L per month since last two years. 

Without proper understanding about trading and markets, I started trading in 2020 and by now I have lost over 66L in total, out of which around 50L was taken as loans. 

Over the past two years I have been able to pay the EMIs with my salary and now the total EMIs are more than my salary and I am unable to last two months EMI. 

I still have around 35L of loan to be repaid. I am out of any options now, I am struggling to keep up with my mental stability and getting suicidal thoughts. 

Kindly help me to get out of this situation.

I have the ability survive in IT industry with my current job. But with the increase in pressure from the lenders for my personal loan, I could  foresee  that I might loose this job as well. 

I don't know how to handle this situation. "
Please tell me what to do ?,"I am 34 years old , a salaried guy , i started trading after corona ... say May 2020 to till today . I saw trading videos & profit screenshots of other ppl .I got motivated & started trading , i traded because paying of my home loan with is 10L left. I didn't told anybody about it . First I traded with my monthly salary & savings. I did options trading  daily to get huge money easily & all the money became zero. Then started taking loans from bank for trading. All those money went off in trading. For example 1 day I made profit of 10k & very next two days I made loss of 50k loss . Then I lend more money to recover my losses. But it didn't happen , then I took loan from app & it also became zero. I did trading during my working hours, it affected my work life & frustration affected my personal life too. In these 3 years I lost 9L money. I made maximum profit of 40k in a day & maximum loss of 85k in a day. Now I am feeling hopeless. I have total 4 loans from bank & app of worth Rs 14L & having zero savings ..plz tell me what to do? ... It became a habit of options trading..i want to leave it .. because of this habit i made loss of 55k today. I am planning a baby nowadays. My family don't know a single thing about it .These loan emis take 65% of salary."
Finally closed my F&o segment in Zerodha ,"Finally came to end. 

Wasted huge savings and many years trying to get success. At end couldn't control emotions inspite of trying for several years 

Hope those who are in less loss close ur f&o section. It will cause disaster

Because of my job somehow able to manage my life inspite of loosing money from 10 years

I am generally gud in money but in trading I behave very different

Trading changes the logical brain üß† bit makes you emotional once you fall in to hope cycle of recovering losses you will loose more and more

Invest in mutual funds or stocks this f&o id waste of time money "
Markets is only for ULTRA RICH,"I may be hated for such a post but I just got to say it. 

Too much retail money is flowing into the markets. To individual stocks and via mutual funds. So if I‚Äôm in a position of power or I have a lot of money. My investment would make less sense and the average retail investor would be making better returns than a millionaire.

How do the ultra rich and Banks and therefore government stop this and keep all the money to themselves? Ultimately they are the market and policy makers

1.	‚Å†FM Sitharaman may increase the tax on CAPITAL GAINS both LTCG and STCG. I‚Äôm pretty much certain this will happen in the next budget.(post election)

2.	‚Å†NSE/BSE will hike their charges for futures and options drastically . May be lesser for stocks. TAXES / stamp duties will also increase.

3. Mutual funds will increase their expense ratios back by policy Rejig and regulations. 

4.	‚Å†There may be an crash, it may dramaticised to such an extent that the average retail investor like you and me will remove all our money from the markets. There will be a play like there‚Äôs blood on the streets. Then at the lowest point the ultra rich will pump in all the money. The low will be lower than the low you have in mind. 

It‚Äôs easy in a bull market to say, I‚Äôm in it for the long term. Just ride the low and pump in more money at lows. Any retail investor will do that. But most will run out money after a YEAR OR TWO. You will start thinking about taking money out since you‚Äôre getting only negative returns. That‚Äôs when the ultra rich enter. 

MARKETS NEVER FAVOUR THE AVERAGE RETAIL INVESTOR. Markets are made by the ultra rich and it will always favour them. MARKETS is not an EQUAL GROUND. They just spin you the story but it is definitely not a fair ground.

This all only a PROBABILTY. But it‚Äôs not like it has never happened. "
Rant: I find most people in this community dumb,"Whenever they post their portfolio of give an opinion about a stock, they can't write why they think this stock will do well. 

I find the valuepickr.com forum more useful than this community. Can we all do like what they are doing? 

Share stats, resources, more nuanced opinions, insights on a particular stock. "
Options trading is a State sanctioned scam. ,"5 yrs in options & I've lost everything. Relationship with family & friends has gone downhill. My family no longer respects me. They don't seek my opinion when anything important is abt to happen at home. I feel like nothing these days. Everything has been ruined by none other but me.
Options trading truly is a state sanctioned scam. No idea how many individuals like me have lost their everything in options. "
What is this electoral bonds scam ,"Hi guys I am trying to understand what‚Äôs happening with this electoral bonds, I am really new to the concept as I have never heard of it before. I would really appreciate if someone can help me understand this in a very basic way. Is it related to some public investments or how ? Will this have an impact on market or not and so on. 


Please be kind as I am trying to just get the understanding about this and learning something new. "

Rich trader have no time for reddit.?,Profitable rich trader with money is not here. So all the novice you don't expect that you'll get some advice from this subreddit. Go and study about market. Don't waste time here. 
We are told to check P/E ratio but how many people know what it means?,"P/E ratio tells you an estimate of how long it would take to recover your investment based on the company's current earnings if all profits were paid out as dividends and the earnings never grew.

Example - if P/E ratio is 10, then it means if you buy entire company, in 10 years, you will recover your entire investment from its profit if company‚Äôs profit remains same. 

And if P/E ratio is 100 then you may not be able to recover your investment in your life time and inflation will also beat you üòÄ.

Investment in companies with high P/E ratio only makes sense if company can grow significantly every year.  PEG ratio can be one of the matrices which can help decide if company is justifying high P/E ratio in such cases.

Sharing the fraud that has occurred with me in name of institutional account.,"Hello guys,

Recently I was duped nearly for 25 lacs of rupees by someone claiming to be from institutional account Blackstone India and Mukesh mehta who appears to be Vice President of Blackstone Private equity group in India.Those guys had everything very well planned from website to scripting of what they talked about. They will allot you shares of different entities at a very low prices in the market in the order of 20000 in case of mine and force you to subscribe this. Also they would send you multiple collection accounts and then ask you to put money.


If anyone of you get these kind of requests or join the group don't join.They are extremely professional scammers operating globally. Try to do transactions with a registered authority only. I got slipped in the greed don't fall for this. 

I don't even know if I would get my money.
If anyone has gone through same kindly help.

Thanks.
P.S. The fraud still is connected and asking me more of 15 lakhs as ransom. He says give me more 15 lakhs and I would return you all money with profits( says around 90 lakhs in my account).

I would put up a detailed thing if I get time to explain things better."
Stop blaming SEBI chairperson,"Stop blaming SEBI‚Äôs chairperson. She was just trying to caution you against dangers. 

At expensive valuations, just a trigger is needed for markets to fall. This trigger can be anything. 

Some war in a distant country, listing of some company, government‚Äôs change in policy, and just a statement. 

In 2022‚Äôs start, IT companies fell heavily (20-45% in mid cap) due to interest rate changes in US followed by a war in Ukraine.

Long-term result? Today they‚Äôre touching ATH.

I can give plenty of examples of this non-correlated falls. I am not talking about events that fundamentally change businesses like Covid boosting Indian steel and chemical demand.

Instead of blaming SEBI chairperson for her statements, newbies should take lessons and move forward. Analyse businesses not only share prices. "
Rant - this sub is full of shitposts!,"I've been following this sub for quite some time and have observed that the quality of this sub has dropped drastically. Although there are few quality posts but all I see is - 

1. I am a student with 5000. Where should I invest?
2. I am 20 years old with 20 lacs. Where should I invest?
3. I have 1 cr in my account. Where should I invest?
4. I am a student with 1 lakh. Where should I invest?
5. I want 1000% returns in 6 months. Where should I invest?
6. I have 50 lacs. Where should I invest?
7. What should I do with my dad's retirement money?

Other questions - 

1. I am a student. Should I do FnO?
2. FnO is a scam. 
3. Should I do FnO with ""Don't"" as a standard templated response. 
4. I invested 2 months ago, and my stock/ MF is not performing well. What should I do?
5. Should I sell / buy this stock?
6. Why is this stock performing well and not going down?
7. When will the market crash happen?

And many other posts like this. Almost every other post is just like this, and it doesn't make any sense to post it again and again. 

Why can't people do simple research before posting such things? Or don't think about it?"

"BJP vs Congress, effect on your investment. Hoping to put some sense in people (non-political post)","Lately I see everyone is asking on various forums about what happens  if BJP loses, will it crash the market. Their logic, BJP is doing great  so market will keep go full speed if BJP wins.

All of this is crap and does not hold any water in long term. This  is a non-political post, as Market does not care who wins, in long term.

Below screenshot link I have shared comparison of returns (Nifty and Sensex)  for time Congress was in power (Apr 2004- March 2014) and BJP (March  2014 - Till date).

[Congress vs BJP - Market returns](https://imgur.com/a/1sgyRao)

Overall returns are 250-280% for both.

Hope it makes sense to all. The overall returns are similar. So stop worrying so much about which party wins.

We invest in good companies, not directly in Nifty or Sensex. If a  specific company /industry drops because of govt policy, then the money  flows into another sector/company. The money goes back into the market.

Please feel free to correct me if my understanding is incorrect."
People are AFRAID and so its the right time to buy UNDERVALUED stocks!!!!!,"Smallcap and Midcap stocks are taking a big hit this month and people have started selling them. This is maybe the best time to buy Undervalued stocks. So, suggest few stocks as per your analysis(Mention the analysis) which will grow in coming time for which others can research and invest in. Suggest stocks with good fundamentals and technicals showing growth prospect in future."
I followed this one easy rule ,You will aslo easily make 1lakh rupee from market by option buying if you do this first thing you just need bank balance of something around 20 -10 lakh and then buy option from tips and social influencers easily your account will left with only 1lakh and you can achieve lucky number which given by India to the world 0. You can also bypass the matrix and you can achieve profit with - this symbol in demat account if you do overtrading best of luck 
What is going on with the market?,"38k Loss today (3.70% down)!!!  
I don't mind the loss as the stocks are fundamentally strong. What bothers me is that Nifty hasn't dipped but still the stocks are falling. Thoughts? "
Gold rate today,"Google shows gold rate at 66.5k.
My local cash for gold guy says it is 63.5k and will give me about 62.2k in hand after his deductions.
Bankbazaar says gold rate is 63.5k.
I do understand gold rate varies and google is probably showing the stock market gold rate.
But is a discrepancy of around 5 percent normal?
Gold rates have shot up in the last few of days.

I said okay I will make a FD of 5 lkh for 9 month at 6% interest , which breaks down to Rs. 2500~  per month.

Monkey and the Stock Market,"The popular Monkey story with valuable lessons for stock market investors.

You‚Äôll love the story and it‚Äôll be in your minds when you make wrong investments in the stock market.




Once upon a time, a rich man from the city arrived in a village. He announced to the villagers that he would buy Monkeys for ‚Çπ 100 each.

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.

They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid ‚Çπ 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.

They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.


Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.

Sensing this, the rich man offers ‚Çπ 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.

They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.

A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay ‚Çπ 300 per monkey.

The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man ‚Äì who bought them all.

There were no Monkeys left in the forest!

One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys ‚Äì this time for ‚Çπ 800 each.

The villagers couldn‚Äôt believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys..

Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.

Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.

This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.

He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.

Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for ‚Çπ 400 each.

‚ÄúSell them back to the rich man at ‚Çπ 800 each when he comes back‚Äù the manager said.

The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.

The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.

There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.

Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.

Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.

What does the monkey story on stock market actually mean?
Well, if you haven‚Äôt understood the analogy already ‚Äì this is exactly what happens when you buy low-quality companies in the stock market.

There will be a low-priced stock which no one is interested to buy. A few rich men will suddenly start buying it.

The stock price will rise, because there are suddenly a lot of buyers and very few sellers. Classic case of huge demand and no supply ‚Äì like the Monkeys in the forest.

The stock gets plenty of coverage on business channels and newspapers. These rich men will also use tricks like sending out bulk SMSes, asking people to buy the shares for huge returns.


New and inexperienced investors, hoping to double and triple their investment, get lured into them.

And finally the big players who had bought the stock early when no one wanted it, sell it back to inexperienced investors at high prices.

Something similar is happening in few companies right at the moment in the stock market!

One fine day, there will be no buyers and only sellers. Those who bought the stock in the final stages of the rise ‚Äì will lose their entire investment.

They will hold the monkeys (shares) for a few years, hoping the stock price rises back. It doesn‚Äôt and the story ends there.

In short, the moral of the stock market story is ‚Äì invest only in quality companies that are selling products which customers love and use.

Don‚Äôt be greedy, there is no quick money in the stock market or in life.

It takes time and effort to become wealthy. And there are no shortcuts!"
Am I the only one?,"Am I the only one who's seeing decline in unrealised gains for the last week.
My 60k Unrealised gains is now at 24k.

Day by day it's growing down in a rapid pace?"
Tata Chem going high high,"Tata Chems is growing. It's just in 3 days, it starting growing like crazy.

Edit: and TATA TECH is growing since I sold it... üò∂

Should we invest in it? I know it's fundamentally good stock and it's not gonna lose in long term. However, how is it for 1+ year holding? Because my time is up to that temporarily "

Correction hasn't happened yet,"I'm not a stock market expert, but a long term investor. The current market scenario is just panic selling in small cap stocks, nifty isn't even 10% down from it's all time high.

And coming to small cap stocks, most of the stocks under my observation had minimum 100% to 400-500% returns in past few months which is truly absurd and unrealistic.

It'll keep on correcting until the return reaches in the range of 30-40% over a year. There will be few exceptions tho who will sustain those huge returns and keep on giving more return but you shouldn't base your expectations because of their results.

I'm up for some discussion so comment your opinion :)"
The crazy power of compounding returns," Heard an in depth quote about the law of 72 and that if you have 15% returns across 50 years you get 10 doubles of your money. Never had really thought about returns in that way before. The example i saw was $5000 invested at age 18 at 15% return would equal $5,000,000 at age 68.

Never had really thought about returns in that way before or how powerful that is because i just kind of thought 10X. The example I saw was $5000 invested at age 18 at a 15% return would equal $5,000,000 at age 68. The madder thing was $500 invested at 19 at 15% returns meant at 69 you had $10.5 million.

I know 15% is at the higher side for annual returns but has anyone actually achieved this in reality here or have I just been seduced by a compounding return calculator?

What are some of the most undervalued stock right now for long term?,"By long term I mean atleast 5-10 years. Here are some of my finds:


1. Anuh Pharma: Has already given a return of 162.2% in a year but I feel it's due for more. With a PE of 19.73, it's lower than it's competitors. A company with 0 debt, increasing sales and profit growth, stable ROE and ROCE. One downside is it's a family owned company with promoter holdings around 70%. Any dispute within the family and the share may tank.           




2. Hindalco: Already someone posted it as being the next multibagger for long term. High increase in sales in last years and is supposed to increase even more during or after the elections.            





3. REC Ltd and PFC: Very good PSU stocks which are rising and will probably rise even higher. Lot of analysis already on this sub regarding these stocks, so won't add more. 

           


4. Ashok Leyland: Kind of a cyclic stock which has been moving sideways for a long time. Very good financials and they are trying to expand their buisness by entering into the overseas market with exports to Africa. Sales and profit growth has increased in the last 3 years. May breakout from the 170 zone very soon. 

      


What are your thoughts on these and if you had to pick one share to invest in right now (not just among these), which one would you choose?"
365 Days Investment Challenge,"Hello Fellow Investors

I am starting a 365 day, Rs 1000 investment challenge starting tomorrow

Everyday I will be picking stocks which would cumulate to Rs 1000 invested/daily for one year. 

I will also diversify in the sense that I will be buying SGBs as per my allocation. I have a habit of buying of 2 SGB shares every allocation, so I might continue on that trend. 

My main stock picking strategy will be coming from seeing stocks which are fundamentally good, but have fallen around 20% or so in the last month. 

I will be start posting under this very topic name for future ease of searching for anyone willing to follow my portfolio's profits or losses.

I will also occasionally book profit on shares if they have increased around 15% or more. This will help me keep going.

Want to hear your views on this and how I can craftily build a good portfolio using this. "

Have you calculated how much should be the size of your SIP for it to be worth 100 Cr when you turn 60?,"While the number will vary with age and other variables but given the average population I thought it might be interesting to trigger some imagination

Another rally,"This is going to be a long post so you can ignore if you don‚Äôt want to read some geeky stuff. Our markets rallied on Friday after GDP numbers, yes the numbers have beaten expectations but as the experts are saying that we might not sustain such numbers because of the fact that private consumption is still not growing. Now coming to the stock markets, few days ago I posted about most of the stocks, especially the PSUs being too expensive and since then there has been some correction in them. But I think there‚Äôs room for more and it will come unexpectedly and eat a lot of gains that people have made since November. The gains people are getting in quant funds are not sustainable as markets cannot grow unreasonaby high every year, I also got a feeling that people in this sub are not very open to discussions but they like to hate on someone saying that the stock they bought is overvalued. My father has been in the markets since the time of Harshad Mehta, he has seen how people lose most of their gains and incur huge losses bcz of operators. If a correction comes, it may turn out to be deep enough to make 80-90% of retail traders stuck with losses and you‚Äôll not be able to figure out if you should hold or just exit at whatever loss you might be bearing. I have studied economics and even the analysts, economists are sure that India‚Äôs domestic demand is not anywhere near the west and we‚Äôre just being too optimistic about the Indian companies. To those who are defending PSU stocks, just think wisely that these companies work for welfare and working on welfare can‚Äôt make you huge profits, same goes with the PSU banks, if all of us are investing and not keeping money in the banks, then these banks will lose deposits and Idk how will they even be profitable without having enough funds. This post is not to hurt someone‚Äôs sentiments but just an advice to people that making 40-50% return in 2-3 months is great but book your profits before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm not hating on any partifular company but what I‚Äôm trying to say is that domestic consumptions is too low to facilitate the profits that corporates and the government are promising. "
What‚Äôs going on with Angel One? It‚Äôs falling like there‚Äôs no tomorrow,"I am new to the market. I invested 50,000 @ 3350. Now it‚Äôs down by around 17% to 2750. There‚Äôs nothing fundamentally wrong with the company. It‚Äôs shown impressive sales and profits growth in the last 3 years. P/E is reasonable. 

Any particular reason it‚Äôs falling so hard. Should I average it down by buying the dip?

Any input would be appreciated. "
Don't panic and do this ,"Just wanted to share my two cents basis a few seperate queries I got on chat

1. This is a correction and upto 5 percent at index level is normal. My guess on the worst will be nifty at 21500-600

2. Large cap stocks are not likely to go below 50 dema, exceptions maybe there. So bottom of your large cap stocks is likely to be there

3. Small and mid caps, if you are holding in derivatives, then exit, but if you are holding via stocks
A. Continue holding mid caps if your stock has corrected by over 15 percent from its high in last one month
B. Small cap - hold only if it's below July 2023 level, else exit


This is a very good time to add investments for long term and don't miss this opportunity"

My trading addiction/journey ,"I came to Hyderabad with small salary 6000 per month in 2006 December from a middle class family

Heard first time about stocks in office but no money to start

Then all our cousins started with buying few stocks and selling it all started like fun and all others stopped understanding that this is not worth. Only myself continued

Started buying 50 stocks selling intraday and then slowly buying 200 300 qty and in few years started doing 500 qty buying and selling

One day I bought huge qty of allahabad bank and averaged and carry forward to next day to recover from loss of 25k . Next day it opened with profit my greed and waited and suddenly it is crashing and i kept on waiting and 25k 50k loss and kept on mounting. Loss went to 1.5 lakh I was shivering and closed it 

That is the day my loss journey started to recover that i continued trading and i am loosing more and more

At that time 1 lakh was huge for me I was recently married at that time I started counting i could have bought tv fridge washing machine

Later i got to know about shorting stocks i used to sell and buy to get profit

I used to buy short mrf stocks to get 300 400 profit. I always get profit but after i fo more and loose.


Then unnecessary learn f&I

I did stocks. F&o. Like everytime I get profit and loose big one day

Then got in to index trading nifty mostly

Then weekly options got introduced
From 1.5 lakhs to 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs 50 lakhs and so on

Since I used to get profits and then loosing after some days I always feel that if could restrict quantity and exit at small loss I would win one day. It never happened 


In this journey i sold 10 grams of gold which I just purchased just like that when I had excess money

I took loan of 2 lakhs and lost it

I loose the salary every month just before 2 days of my salary or after 2 days of salary day

I used to give money to friends for interest got all that money and lost

My parents gave 2 lakhs to save even that i kept in trading

Literally except my rent and monthly expenses i used to waste every bit of my salary in my trading

I have java training and earned 10 lakhs and wasted that

Literally every amount that I have i keep transfering to zerodha and gain few days and try to do big quantity or trade until 3:30 and make profit of 5k 10k to 1 lakh 2 lakh loss by closing


Only one gud thing I did was to open sukanya sanariddi account on name of my 2 daughters and saved 20 lakhs there and got my pf of 20 lakhs and i have 6 lakhs 

After earning 17 years like doney have saved only this . I should have 1.5 crore and if i had invested that it would have taken care of my future

Now I am 40 and i don't know how many years I will survive in job

For loop{

Sop(I will do less qty and come out of less loss)
Sop(got 2k wow)
Sop(got 10k nice u can achieve future in trading)
Sop( increase quantity yaar we can get gud profitsbto recover past losses)
Sop(by 12 pm 10k profit man u r rocking let's increase profit 5k loss shit let me trade to recover, 20k loss let me add more quantity to recover 50k losss shittt let me buy 1000 qty 1 lakh 2 lakhs loss. In emotions I close hedge positios take stop losses buy huge quantity without hedging hoping to recover)

Shit what is happening to my life I will stop trading

Let us give one more try this time carefully 

And this loop continued for 10 years without success start with small quantity get profit gets as if i mastered increasing quantity and loosing

You should know how to add break statment in for loop

Finally on this Monday i added break statement to come out of my 10 years for loop

Software people understand my system out print ln and while loop

Hope u come out of ur loop immediately

Please wish me strength to face and give gud life to my kids and buy house for me. Don't know if it happens or not in my life

Please feel free to reach to me to sharr ur emotional distress


I thought of stopping in 2020 but finally closed few days ago

"Beware of scam, screener is not enough!!","A lof people got burned by Varanium Cloud recently. Some folks even put a big chunk of their savings into it. So what went wrong? Mostly, it seems like people were following tips or just did superficial study. You look Varanium on a screener app, and everything looks amazing - crazy revenue and profit growth, rock-bottom PE ratio, all too good to be true, right? That's the red flag! When things look too perfect, dig deeper.
Now, if you don't understand the company's product itself, here's what you can do:

1. Do a google search on company and on promoter names. A quick search might reveal past controversies, like how Varanium's founder was involved in something shady before.

2. Check LinkedIn. Look at the profiles of the promoters running the company and see their experience. Also, see how many employees they actually have - a tiny team for a big company is a bad sign.

3. Dive into online forums like Valuepickr. See what other investors are saying about the company based on their research. These folks might have uncovered some hidden truth.

Edit - Here, beware of scam, I meant scam in SME segment. Not in screener.

For more such information, you can check my X handle (https://x.com/growth_picker) [I don‚Äôt sell any courses]"

How would you Invest 10Cr today?,"How would you Invest 10Cr today? Doesn't have to be in stock market exclusively. All investment options are available.

My family recently sold some land in the outskirts of a very quickly developing metro city and is looking to re-invest a small part of the proceeds. How would you Invest this amount? Please mention the investment Avenue, Amount and the reasoning behind it. Risk appetite is medium and looking to hold the investment for atleast 7-10 years.

We have obviously been in contact with many PMS, investment management companies and banks specialising in these investments and will be meeting with them and deciding on the investments in the next month or so. We will be investing through a professional PMS but was curious about how you would invest the amount in contrast to how a PMS or an investment bank would. Fire away!

HUL,"So I bought HUL at 2400 in 2021 & again at 1950 in March 2022 because of some youtuber. I was happy because it was the lowest it ever went since 2020. Fast forward 2 years I have just 1% return on it. On the other hand, I also bought TCPL at similar time and have 56% returns on it. Had GCPL some time ago which I also sold at 30%+ returns.
This is the reason why I sold HDFC Bank today on a loss."

FNO!!,"Let me tell u one of the easiest way to earn money is to do FNO.but there is a chach u will not earn a single penny from it.
Fno is only for strong psychology ppl, you'll think that u can make money u can control ur emotions,but not. trust me after loosing almost 1L iam saying this, quite fno if you have any losses accept them and stop fno. Ik you ppl not ganna listen, coz iam the same as u, I have seen posts that says ""I took lones for fno now iam in 10L lose plz help me iam traumatized "" i didn't care all of this at that time.
But now I know how this feels.
Trust me as a middle class boy I want to give genuine advice for u nd myself to don't get into risky shit,and work hard stay invested earn money,try to sleep every night with peace.



Ik to get succed in life one must work there ass off and take risk in life ,but that risk should be as minimum as possible that keeps ur family happy.


Important*= block all those social media influencers who post there fno profit coz that's the main reason for loss and going again towards fno.
I learnt my lesson i hope this experience may help some other person "

Cash flow margin: **25.37%**

3Y rev. growth: **26.83%**

3Y CF growth: **46.73%**

3Y EPS growth: **38.33%**

Everything either way better than industry average or is sticking to the average.

At that time , it had just an 2 digit share price.
But today , it's a bit close to become 4 digit share price. It delivered an 1000% return in span of 4 years . 
It was very fascinating to see the turnaround of the Tata Motors.
I have saw some stocks which have an very good amount of revenues but aren't much respected by market .
1 . Rajesh Exports
I saw the revenues and the portfolio of the company. The company manages processing of gold  . It process about 35% of total gold in the world. However , there is an sharp decline in the profitability of the company. 

2.  Piramal Enterprises .
This company is a lot controversial to most of you because of its poor performance this days . However this company is well diversified.

However, if the management works hard in turning the tables of these companies, a big turnaround could be seen in the companies . 
If someone is thinking of investing money for an range of 10+ years , one can make an small position in these . 
However, I am not an financial advisor and to invest in these companies, please first take advice from your financial advisor.

Public companies on electoral bonds purchaser list,"Would you trust your money on companies that purchased electoral bonds? 

As a value investor, I find it a big red flag - I will exit all my positions in companies that have invested in electoral bonds. These companies' share price may increase in the short term, but over the long term, they are highly likely to be corrupt and will end up lining only their own pockets.

I have compiled a list of public companies in this link - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmQhzURaul1joflr3ogcevIdsaLfXFEN2T0l1PR9F-NZlsRJ17KEmLddoYwkb2evaT0l2GUIasj3s-/pub?output=csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQmQhzURaul1joflr3ogcevIdsaLfXFEN2T0l1PR9F-NZlsRJ17KEmLddoYwkb2evaT0l2GUIasj3s-/pub?output=csv)"
How do you find mutibaggers when they were small caps?,"Stocks that become huge like MRF, Symphony and Waree in recent times.

Jumping from family business to stock market.,"I am a software engineer my big brother is handling our family business. But since the business is not doing good, He said he will invest in the stock market (even though he doesn't have savings for that). I feel this decision of his is may be influenced by YT reels and friends. I don't agree with his decision, but since I cannot see any other option and he is my brother I decided to support him by providing 10 lakhs (A big amount for me).

I feel without doing hard work you cannot earn money, there must be some skillset which is required for this field.  
Can you please help me with following questions.

1. How can I test that he has some understanding of Stock market and will survive it.
2. What study material or practise will you suggest so that he can be on right path.
3. What other things I can do to help him in this journey?

I have limited knowledge of stock market and given my limited bandwidth I cannot dive deep into this. Thats why I am asking help from you experienced guys.  
I checked ""varsity"" by zerodha, seems like a good start. But I dont know how much of help it will be in the real practical.

\[Update-1\]: This is my 1st post here, I didn't know we have such helpful community. Please accept my gratitude. You guys have been really helpful."
HELP ME CONFRONT ZERODHA,"Zerodha is claiming that Yesterday i.e 14th March 2024, not even a single user faced any issue related to the app which got them logged out or which render them unable to place buy/sell their market orders

Yesterday @9:19 am while trying to exit from my current position the app showed a pop up ""something went wrong"" and when I tried to exit once again, I got logged out right after the pop up ""Something went wrong"". Now due to this issue I couldn't exit my position on time and suffered a loss which I had to book later that day.

I didn't take any screenshots of the error or that I was logged out and so without any evidence I confronted zerodha to which they claimed that not a single user of zerodha faced this technical issue which I mentioned that particular day and that the issue was from my end.

Is there anyone who faced any kind of technical issue which made it difficult for them to place the order or got them logged out (on 14th March only) and have got proof, I would really appreciate if you could share this.

Im not looking for any legal actions nor Im trying to get any monetary compensation from them, Im aware that its not gonna happen. I just want to show it to their face when they made this bold claim esp when we're aware of their history with glitches. So if anyone has any proof, pls feel free to attach it

Thanks in advance

PS - Only send if you have genuine proof and not something forged otherwise it'll backfire immensely on me. And I apologise in advance for offending anyone who's a zerodha loyalist."

IS PRIVATE BANK BULL RUN COMING ?,so hdfc and kotak bank which are a big contributor to bank 50  which contribute a lot in the Bank 50 . the average PE of banking sector is 15.8 which is very less compared  to other  sectors of the market . and in election the governments  are going to try to  reduce the interest rate to get vote and this year we have Indian n and american elections too. so i can give a bet that the USA FED is going to cut down on the interest  rate beecause the inflation in the economy  is under control. and as the interest rate goes down the profits of the banks is going to increase . i have put 50 percent of my portfolio in banking and financial sector 25 percent in raw material and  manufacturing . and the rest in FMCG .  
PRIVATE BANKS ARE UNDERVALUED ?,"After the so called gambling run of the PSU sectors . the stock market is going to continue to go side ways for 2 months at least. it might go 5 to 6 percent to around 21000 . the sector which i have increased my holdings is Private bank sector Like Hdfc , Au bank and  city union bank because there PE is really low and there growth rate is quite good . i have very good chunk of my portfolio in these private bank sector . the pe of this sector is below average and  most of the bank pe are less than 20.

21 EMA STRATEGY !!,"I‚Äôve been using this strategy for 6 months now 
I used to use this strategy when I started my trading career in 2019

I wanted to know how many of y‚Äôall here use this strategy and how you use it what are your rules and risk management and entry exit signal 

I‚Äôll share mine here,
TF - 5M
Mark my zones S/R on 1H TF

Switch to 5M

When price breaks above 21EMA closes above 21 EMA that‚Äôs the trigger candle and if next candle is also bullish and breaks the high of trigger candle and closes above it that‚Äôs my entry signal on next candle 
And SL is low of the candle which broke above 21EMA simple
Accuracy is 55-60% and RR is take is 1.1.5
1 trade is enough for the day 

Hope this helps to new traders

And would also love to know from experienced traders their view ! "

15% STCG tax does not apply to most traders.,"
The 15% Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) tax does not apply to most traders. Many traders here are under the false impression that if their profits are short-term, they only have to pay 15% STCG tax. However, this is not correct. There are two ways to tax stock market profits: 


1) via capital gains (STCG, LTCG)
2) via business income taxation as per tax slabs.

Those who:
1) invest via mutual funds
2) invest in shares for the long term
3) invest in shares for the short term but infrequently
4) have a mix of the above

Have to pay using capital gain taxation.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

On the other hand, those who:
1) trade in F&O
2) trade intraday
3) trade in equity regularly
4) have a mix of the above

Have to show trading as business income and pay taxes according to their tax slabs.

One can use both ways of taxation (like I do), but they have to keep their portfolios separate.

Aavas financiers 5% down,"I was tracking Aavas financiers for 6+ months. It never came closer to my target of 1350.

My stock picks and reasons,"ITC: because it fell, dividends

Bank of india: low p/b p/e than peers and sector and i am a customer

Kotak and HDFC: only large banks that havent given a run up since 3 4 years, miney will likely be rotated here from overvalued sectors

Asian paints: because it fell, grasim has entered but asian paints has already large market share and has diversified business, though the other line of business like home decor etc is a minor part of overall business for now

Titagarh: pvt company i guess will have to check again, good order book, overvalued right now i guess but will average if comes down

Indiabulls hsg fin: recovering from the bad times, read investor calls, will be repaying significant debt in coming quarters

Jiofin: because motabhai jis sector me aenge waha inka hi stock lenge

IDFC: merger ratio benefit and idfc fb is in reputed and experienced hands, will take time to grow

LT: because it fell, strong order book

Ashok leyland: cause my relative works here and acc to investor calls, demand will likely pick up, it got hampered due to elections (someone explain plz)

Here is what SEBI has been doing:*,"
*Measure:* Gradually raising upfront margin collection from clients to 100 percent. Meaning, brokers needs to ensure that the client pays the entire margin amount before being allowed to trade impact.
*Impact:* This has resulted in clients taking up only positions to the extent possible with their own funds. Also, since brokers can't fund client positions, this has helped reduce overtrading by clients.

*Measure:* Introduction of additional surveillance mechanism (ASM) and graded surveillance mechanism (GSM) on the bourses
*Impact:* This has reduced price manipulation in many mid, small and microcap stocks. While price rigging cannot be done away with totally, it has made it much more tougher for manipulators to cause sharp price moves. By forcing delivery-based transactions in stocks, which have risen sharply, interests of the genuine investors are protected.

*Measure:* Sending notices to brokers for any transaction that may appear suspicious, on the same day itself, seeking details of those trades.
*Impact:* This has helped check instances of circular trading by a set of traders acting in concert. While this measure, too, can't eliminate unfair trading practices altogether, it makes players think twice before trying to indulge in such acts. That is because the probability of being noticed is much higher now.

*Measure:* Reduction in timeline for listing for initial public offering from T+6 to T+3. This means shares must list on the exchange on the third working day after allotment to investors.
*Impact:* This has helped reduce speculation in the grey market over the likely listing price.

*Measure:* Warning AMFI of ‚Äúfroth‚Äù in mid and smallcap stocks and nudging it to moderate inflows into small and midcap equity schemes.
*Impact:* It has sent out a clear signal to small investors that valuations have become risky and that need to be more careful of the kind of equity asset they are putting money in. It has also forced mutual funds to become more disciplined in their selection of stocks.

Icici Bank & Icici Securities Merger,"Just being called every hour from ICICI bank employees to vote for the merger, it‚Äôs so annoying. 

For every 100 share of ICICI securities 57 of the banks shares would be swapped. Quantum mutual fund has voted against the merger. If the bank employees are pestering you to vote for the merger, then these crocked mother f***kers are trying to screw you (this is my opinion)

Edit: I just voted against the merger, let‚Äôs see what happens next. "
ICICI Bank ,"Imo ICICI Bank is a better bet than HDFC bank i bought both stock around the same time ICICI at 699 which now has CMP of 1,097 and HDFC Bank at 1,460 which has CMP of 1,442 . 

I believe icici has a lot more potential than HDFC Bank and in medium term it will cross hdfc bank in terms of stock price (not market cap) as difference is very less now . Both have similar P/E BUT ICICI Bank gross NPA is a bit more than HDFC Bank . ICICI gave a very good yoy growth compared to HDFC Bank.

Currently i don't think the price is good to enter for short term coz it could get a correction of 4-7% 



Is there any other private bank you think I should keep my eyes üëÄ on . If bandhan Bank audit comes out clean it could give good returns "
