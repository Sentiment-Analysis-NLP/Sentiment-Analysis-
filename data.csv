1 Trillion Rupees worth without a single product! - Varun Beverages,"
I would like to draw your attention towards the Pepsi’s largest manufacturer and distributor in India - VBL!

Few things to keep in mind:

- With 25+ years of operations, Varun Beverages or VBL is Pepsi’s top 3 franchisees in the world outside US.

- The company operates in three broad segments:

- -Carbonated Soft Drinks which contributes to 71% of the portfolio volume. Products include: soft drinks (e.g., Pepsi 7Up) energy drinks (e.g., Sting), club soda and carbonated juice drinks

- -Non Carbonated beverages which contributes to nearly 25% of the portfolio volume. Products include: fruit-pulp drinks (eg., Tropicana), ice tea (under Lipton brand), sports drinks (e.g., Gatorade), packaged drinking water (e.g., Aquafina) and in-house dairy based drink (under the Creambell brand).

- Food Products. Products include: Kurkure Puffs in India and Lays and Doritos in Africa.

- With BevCo’s acquisition, the firm will get access to four new product lines. Products include: Caffeine drink - Refreshhh, Energy Drink - Reboost, Carbonated Drink - Coo-ee and Alternative Drinks -JiVE

- It has 42 manufacturing facilities (36 in India & 6 in International territories). Also, the firm completed a capacity–driven capex of 2100 cr. in 2023 and has planned for 3600 cr. in 2024 of which 600 cr. is earmarked for international markets. As per the management, with new plants, the revenue potential will double in the coming years.

- In terms of geography, Indian business contributes to 80% of overall sales. Within India, it operates in 27 states and 7 UT. Remaining sales are international, from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Morocco, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

- Varun Beverages is part of the $15B + Jaipuria Group. The group runs the listed firm Devyani International (KFC India, Pizza Hut) and Pearl Drinks, manufacturer of PET bottles. Almost a vertically integrated ecosystem for Pepsi.

- The firm has had a long history with Pepsi. It has grown from 26% contribution to sales in 2011 to 90% contribution in Pepsi sales in 2023. It has the ‘right to manufacturer Pepsi in India’ till 2039 so unlikely to have another firm break this space.

- With over 39 manufacturing facilities, 120 depots, owned fleet of 2500 vehicles, over 2400 primary distributors, 35 lakh outlets and 10 lakh Visi-coolers, VBL’s on ground infrastructure remains a key driver for company’s growth.

- Varun Beverages Limited (VBL) reported a 20% growth in revenue with an 18% volume growth YoY in Q4 CY23. Despite the increase in cost of sugar, the company still ended with improved EBITDA margin. This improvement was due to softening bottling costs and operational efficiencies

- Net debt increased to Rs 4,700 Cr in 2023 from Rs 3,400 Cr in 2022, an increase of 38% due to growth Capex. But, given this is for capacity expansion, the debt is good as long as it can remain controlled. The interest coverage is 11.4x which means firm can pay back interests for this year

- And finally, with my valuation models (both DCF and relative) the stock is highly overvalued so it is not a value play at the moment. However, equity research analysts are claiming a median rise of 1490 (Sharekhan, Motilal, DAM, Nuvama, K.R. Choksey, Indsec and others) with as high as 1732 driven by market growth parameters.

Please check out the link where I further detail this out. Your feedback will help me course correct and increase the depth of my analysis:

I have lost almost 1.8 cr in stock market since 2017 but I am still hopeful ,"I have lost almost 1.8 Crore since 2017... (57 lakh in Bitcoin it was froud with me , rest 1.2 crore or nearby from F&O and stocks). 
Whenever I buy put option the market goes against me if the same day I booked a loss then it will come down ... If I buy a call then the same thing happens. It's been happening for 7 years as of now. Even on 28 March 2024 in the morning I was bearish so the market was almost touched at an all time high and I closed my position in a loss near 3 pm. After I  booked a loss within 5 Min the market came down almost 250 pts in nifty and 400 pts in bank nifty. 
I know it's very high loss , due to this my wife's left me. She filed  divorce case too. Currently I am earning 7-8 lakh from my profession. Right now I have a few lakhs of loans that can be cleared. Right now I have 10 lakh capital in my hand and I know I can get my lost money back from the market, but I don't know how... I know for one thing for sure if the market took my money then the market will give my money back too... But the question is how .. I tried all the ways but every time I failed. I don't want cash based trade in equity because it will take a very long time... If someone who is genuine then I can share my demat so she/he can trade and I will share profit with that person. "

Sharing the fraud that has occurred with me in name of institutional account.,"Hello guys,

Recently I was duped nearly for 25 lacs of rupees by someone claiming to be from institutional account Blackstone India and Mukesh mehta who appears to be Vice President of Blackstone Private equity group in India.Those guys had everything very well planned from website to scripting of what they talked about. They will allot you shares of different entities at a very low prices in the market in the order of 20000 in case of mine and force you to subscribe this. Also they would send you multiple collection accounts and then ask you to put money.


If anyone of you get these kind of requests or join the group don't join.They are extremely professional scammers operating globally. Try to do transactions with a registered authority only. I got slipped in the greed don't fall for this. 

I don't even know if I would get my money.
If anyone has gone through same kindly help.

Thanks.
P.S. The fraud still is connected and asking me more of 15 lakhs as ransom. He says give me more 15 lakhs and I would return you all money with profits( says around 90 lakhs in my account).

I would put up a detailed thing if I get time to explain things better."
We are told to check P/E ratio but how many people know what it means?,"P/E ratio tells you an estimate of how long it would take to recover your investment based on the company's current earnings if all profits were paid out as dividends and the earnings never grew.

Example - if P/E ratio is 10, then it means if you buy entire company, in 10 years, you will recover your entire investment from its profit if company’s profit remains same. 

And if P/E ratio is 100 then you may not be able to recover your investment in your life time and inflation will also beat you 😀.

Investment in companies with high P/E ratio only makes sense if company can grow significantly every year.  PEG ratio can be one of the matrices which can help decide if company is justifying high P/E ratio in such cases.

Just Stop!,"Holy shit the number of people who loose money in F&O is crazy high! It's a hedging instrument dum dums not a money printer! I see so many posts some/most of whom are not in great financial positions in life gambling away their or their families money in exchange for fuck all! 

Your life won't change with that 4-5k profit per lot man. That's not what the market is. There are people who win consistently no denying but to be one of them you need to dedicate yourself into understanding a staggering amount of information, coupled with a large experiential exposure to the markets. 

And many of the posts you see on here, who show off their one off 'wins' have just gotten lucky on those specific trades.


Have some sense. Please.

My trading addiction/journey ,"I came to Hyderabad with small salary 6000 per month in 2006 December from a middle class family

Heard first time about stocks in office but no money to start

Then all our cousins started with buying few stocks and selling it all started like fun and all others stopped understanding that this is not worth. Only myself continued

Started buying 50 stocks selling intraday and then slowly buying 200 300 qty and in few years started doing 500 qty buying and selling

One day I bought huge qty of allahabad bank and averaged and carry forward to next day to recover from loss of 25k . Next day it opened with profit my greed and waited and suddenly it is crashing and i kept on waiting and 25k 50k loss and kept on mounting. Loss went to 1.5 lakh I was shivering and closed it 

That is the day my loss journey started to recover that i continued trading and i am loosing more and more

At that time 1 lakh was huge for me I was recently married at that time I started counting i could have bought tv fridge washing machine

Later i got to know about shorting stocks i used to sell and buy to get profit

I used to buy short mrf stocks to get 300 400 profit. I always get profit but after i fo more and loose.


Then unnecessary learn f&I

I did stocks. F&o. Like everytime I get profit and loose big one day

Then got in to index trading nifty mostly

Then weekly options got introduced
From 1.5 lakhs to 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs 50 lakhs and so on

Since I used to get profits and then loosing after some days I always feel that if could restrict quantity and exit at small loss I would win one day. It never happened 


In this journey i sold 10 grams of gold which I just purchased just like that when I had excess money

I took loan of 2 lakhs and lost it

I loose the salary every month just before 2 days of my salary or after 2 days of salary day

Literally except my rent and monthly expenses i used to waste every bit of my salary in my trading

I have java training and earned 10 lakhs and wasted that

Literally every amount that I have i keep transfering to zerodha and gain few days and try to do big quantity or trade until 3:30 and make profit of 5k 10k to 1 lakh 2 lakh loss by closing


Only one gud thing I did was to open sukanya sanariddi account on name of my 2 daughters and saved 20 lakhs there and got my pf of 20 lakhs and i have 6 lakhs 

After earning 17 years like doney have saved only this . I should have 1.5 crore and if i had invested that it would have taken care of my future

Now I am 40 and i don't know how many years I will survive in job

For loop{

Sop(I will do less qty and come out of less loss)
Sop(got 2k wow)
Sop(got 10k nice u can achieve future in trading)

Upstox ruined my ELSS Investments,"I need suggestions. I also posted this on another sub, Mutual Funds India. 

I invested 1.3 L in ELSS Mutual Funds on 22-03-2024 at ~8.00 PM for Tax Savings this year in selective 5 funds using Upstox. 
As we all know this date won't be counted, as the cut off time for Mutual Funds transactions are 3 PM. The next 3 days are non-business days i.e. Saturday, Sunday and Monday as it was Holi. Now comes Tuesday, 26-03-2024 I receive a message from Upstox regarding my orders for Quant ELSS Tax Saver that it has been ""Placed"" and no updates for other funds. I called Upstox to know about my other investments, they told me to wait for T+2 days before reaching them. Mind you I have received no communication or status of orders from the app. It is usually says ""In process. Units to be credited to portfolio"" from day one for all the funds. It is even the same status at the time of this writing. 

I waited for updates the next 2 days. Created several tickets and emailed them, but they never once reached out to me or updated me about the order statuses. My portfolio for Quant was however, was moving forward with updates from the AMC (Quant) themselves using messages. 

Today at 10PM, the last business day of this financial year I am seeing my funds being credited back to my account except the quants. None of my investment orders were placed. Upstox didn't even update me. This will lose me a lot of money.

Just to give the context, I invest 1L for my GF as well on 23-03-2024 Saturday at ~8 PM. She received all of her funds on time by 27-03-2024. Only difference is that hers was through Groww app. Same funds. 

Can I do something do something about this? I am really disheartened. Upstox didn't communicate or replied to my emails or tickets. Their customer service is pathetic, they are 9 out of 10 times are unreachable and that one time, they will keep telling to wait for T+3 days before any updates. The orders are still in process, with status ""They have sent this order to exchanges"". Can I sue them? Can complain to SEBI? Can they be held responsible for anything ? "

More precisely I was looking if it is good time to invest in these stocks before election, What I think rn is that markets has already predicted stable govt after 2024 Lok Sabha elections, that is what reflecting in these high gains numbers, but not to say, there is an opportunity of some gains in these stocks because of elections.

Not to mention, a large stock price correction is possible if there is a change in government or if margin with opposition is small in number of seats vote etc."

Got lucky today with Gravita India,"I bought Gravita in December last year at a price of 1105 of around 2 Lakhs. Stock goes into downtrend. I averaged it slowly and my average price reduced to 1032 of around 3 Lakhs. This is a big amount for my portfolio. The stock price touched 730 a couple of weeks ago so I was in big loss.

I don't know what happened but the stock started recovering and yesterday it touched my resistance and closed below it.  It was still 10% less than my price but I decided to book loss. I called my friend and said that I will sell this stock in the morning when the market opens.

Today I woke up late at 9.30. I saw huge gains in my portfolio and noticed Gravita was up by 12%. Price was around 1040. I sold at market price and it was sold at 1036. Since then stock price reduced by 5%. I got extremely lucky today as I sold it on top. I would have sold it yesterday also but I was not watching the market.

I have read these type of incidents on this sub and always wondered when will this happen to me. It happened with me today. I didn't make any profit but I was able to exit from a stock without making the loss. "

21 EMA STRATEGY !!,"I’ve been using this strategy for 6 months now 
I used to use this strategy when I started my trading career in 2019

I wanted to know how many of y’all here use this strategy and how you use it what are your rules and risk management and entry exit signal 

I’ll share mine here,
TF - 5M
Mark my zones S/R on 1H TF

When price breaks above 21EMA closes above 21 EMA that’s the trigger candle and if next candle is also bullish and breaks the high of trigger candle and closes above it that’s my entry signal on next candle 
And SL is low of the candle which broke above 21EMA simple
Accuracy is 55-60% and RR is take is 1.1.5
1 trade is enough for the day 

Hope this helps to new traders

"Depressed, and unable to focus on my career due to f&I losses","Depressed and unable to focus on my career, panicking due to f&o losses

I am a 26 years old male, doctor, i am studying for my upcoming pg medical exams. Started doing trading and fno 3 years back, for 2 years I was in small losses. This year started well and i entered the market with very small capital of 10k and made 2L profits just in a few days, continuously winning, which covered all my previous losses. Then I lost the entire amount in 2 loss making days, and to recover kept doing. Now I am in 1.5L loss this year and net around 3L loss. 

I don't know what has happened, whenever I take a call since past few days, the market suddenly gives breakthrough in opposite direction. Never such a thing happened previously when I traded. I am really lost now, won't trade atleast for a few days but i don't know what to do. Feeling depressed and unable to focus on my study.

Everytime the thought is coming to my mind how i could have cashed out the 2L+ profits. I am also a freelancer part time as a hobby as I am not working professionally as of now so the time I give in the market, I can easily make the same amount in a week to two if I give that time to my freelancing. Have made 30L+ profits through freelancing in the past 1 year (did fd of it) still I am unable to come up to the fact that I am making loss in fno after such a profitable streak and so I keep trading again and again just so I can be profitable even though I could earn much more otherwise, and in an effort and in net loss of 3L in past 3 years. I just have 2 months for my exams and if I clear that and get pg in USA which I am aiming for, I would easily make there starting 5 LPM in beginning, to guaranteed 20 LPM+ (in inr) after 3 years of residency there. This is my last chance to pursue my dream there.

Still i don't know why I am trading regularly, maybe be ego is coming in between that how I lose so much amount and I haven't told my parents which is bothering me more and more. 

Please advice how to cope up with this and focus on my work. I am feeling extremely depressed and unable to study. This is not a troll post, this is my throwaway account as on my original id many real life friends know me. Please advice, please guide. I am extremely depressed and unable to focus or study 😭."

Lost 50k.,"Tried fno on and off since last 6 months. Was breaking even trading fno early on, later made a big loss of 20 k in one session, put a bigger bet that day and recovered loss. This made me bet more over next few days and lost 50 k. Vowed not to trade ever again. But after a few days bought cheap options and lost 3-4k. The best thing I did now was to mail groww to disable fno. I dont trade now. Addiction is real and insidious. I would advise beginners like me to use only a fixed amount per month for trading in a seperate account. And never break that rule for greed or to breakeven your losses. If option trading is still profitable for you then its a win. If you cant control this then stop early before you lose an amount that hurts and losses seem unrecoverable."

My 1 year of trading journey,"Yep, this day marks my 1 year trading anniversary, yayyy! I've made many mistakes, learned from those mistakes, made new mistakes everytime, learned the importance of discipline, psychology, money management also with trading.
 Financially speaking I'm breakeven with whatever the capital I had so I'm happy. Now I have experience and capital so looking forward to learn new lessons and techniques.
Summarising my trading journey I started with option buying with a capital of 15k, made profit of 13k then had to take break because of exams, then came back lost nearly 17k then shifted towards option selling/hedging. Dabbled a bit and incurred an additional 5k loss. I was sad, upset, not feeling good but kept on following rules, sticked to that one strategy, developed some discipline and recovered the loss within these 3 months. So now, I'm breakeven, with a good knowledge, willing to learn more in this next accounting year(and hopefully earn hehe) 
I also tried everything like Positional, Intraday, Swing and what not in stocks as well as derivatives. Got to know my core strength area and now sticking to that. 
Any bits of advice is appreciated:)"
Is FD good idea at 24?,"I am 24 Yo and have been working for 2 years. And currently I have not yet invested anything anywhere. My savings till now is about  1.5L and my salary now is 80k in hand (I give 30k to my parents so monthly I am now left with 50k) . I've been thinking of investing now since I have a stable job and earning avg amount. What I am thinking now is to put my current savings as FD and start investing from what I earn now. So something like 1.25L to FD for 1 year 3 months at 7.1% interest and reinvest it. Is that a good idea?   
  
Also I've been thinking to have a RD of 5k/m as an emergency amount for same amount of time and interest which would yield around 78k after 1 year 3 months. Then reinvest this amount as FD along with whatever the amount I get from above FD.

Is this at all a good idea? Finance makes no sense to me tbh."
Bought a penny stock (RattanIndia Power Ltd.) and now selling it is limited,Bought this penny stock and now I place an order to sell but the order keeps getting unsuccessful. The stock does hit higher or lower circuit but not for the entire day. Why does my order not get processed then? I'm using paytm money.

"Zomato, fit for marathon?","Zomato was the first stock I owned when I entered stock market. I chose it solely based on hindsight. However, the stock went through twist-and-turns especially after Russian attached Ukraine back in early 2022.

Although now I have appreciable knowledge of fundamental analysis, I still struggle to project the future of this stock. The market fabrication it beholds and operates on, looks compelling for long-term (~8 years). The company's financials say otherwise (for the short-term at least).

In your opinion, on what basis do you envision Zomato share price becoming (or not becoming) 5× or 10× of its CMP? 

Would appreciate responses. Thanks!"
Help in investing my Salary,"I am a recent graduate working as a software engineer. I started my job in October and accumulated some savings in my bank. Currently it's around 3.5lakhs.

Going to accumulate Indigrid Invit now ,"After accumulating Embassy REIT for the past three years I took a decision to expand and get the exposure of INVITs. Hence, after doing my research work, I've come to a conclusion that among all the traded INVITs, Indigrid looks the best. It has a huge AUM, stable distribution and a stable guidance for future acquisitions. And personally speaking, I see huge growth potential in the power sector of India. Let's hope for the best

My plan is to have REIT and INVIT in my long term portfolio for their quarterly distribution. 

If anyone wants to have a quick chat about REITs and INVITs, I'm happy to guide them "

How good is Jefferies prediction? Past performance? ,"Hi, 

I hope everyone heard the news about the global brokerage firm Jefferies making a prediction about 11 Indian stocks with high growth potential in coming year.

"I looked up 5 year returns of MFs, ETFs, my model portfolio and Index to start investing, what do you guys suggest based on the results?","I'm thinking of starting to invest properly from FY24. I've tried trading before, but I lost about 1.5 lakhs. And when I've bought stocks, I've ended up selling too soon and missing out on profits. So, I'm considering a systematic investment plan (SIP) where I invest regularly and forget about it for 10 years.

At first, I thought about mutual funds (MFs), but a friend said exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might be better because they have lower expense ratios. However, when I checked, MFs have actually been doing better than ETFs for the past five years irrespective of the high expense ratios.

My colleagues suggested direct stock investment, but then my model portfolio of 20 stocks I was planning to SIP was also beaten by the MFs. 

I feel the MFs are superior in every way but still both my friend and colleagues are not convinced. Am I missing something here?

Aavas Financiers,"Currently, fundamentals look stronger than ever though the Long term borrowing has jumped quite a bit but, the company is managing to record consistent & decent increase in Revenue and PAT, however, the promotor has been selling their stakes every quarter. 

If we look at the technicals then you'll notice that the stock has been on a downtrend since past 2 years now and has broken the  support of 1337 and heading towards 1273 which seems like the last support level before the stock drowns below 1000.

ICICI Securities to Merge with ICICI Bank!,"ICICI Securities is gearing up to be delisted and merge with ICICI Bank, becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. The proposal got the green light from shareholders, with a solid 71.9% of minority shareholders giving it the thumbs up, surpassing the required majority. Public institutional shareholders were even more supportive, with a whopping 83.8% in favor. Shareholders of ICICI Securities are in for a treat as they will receive 67 shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 shares they currently hold. Despite some pushback from minority shareholders, the delisting bid sailed through, paving the way for ICICI Securities to join forces with ICICI Bank."

PBCL limited - is market correction a good opportunity to enter!?,"I would like to bring PCBL share back up again on the radar again as there is a good buying opportunity after the 20% correction.

Few things to keep in mind:

PCBL Ltd is India’s largest carbon black producer and the 7th largest
worldwide. Infact, it commands a 35% – 40% market share of the domestic carbon black market, with other players having sub-20% market share.

The firm operates in three major segments: Rubber Black - Tyres ( 65% of the revenue), Rubber Black - Non Tyres (25% of revenue - e.g., conveyer belt, industrial hoses) and specialty chemicals (10% of revenue - e.g., foodplate, print ink, camera body etc.)

There are two new areas (both high-margin) that PCBL will further diversify into in 2024:

Post its 3800 crore acquisition of Aquapharm, India’s largest phosphonate manufacturer, PCBL gets access to water treatment sector. Aquapharm has all the largest FMCG (e.g., P&G, Reckitt, Unilever) as its clients so PBCL is inheriting a strong business base
It has invested 130 crore to get 51% stake in the JV with Australia silicon nano-technology specialist Kinaltek limited. This will give access to battery applications esp. for EV batteries
Currently, 70% of the overall demand is domestic in nature. Domestic demand for carbon black is increasing, driven by the expansion of tyre manufacturing capacities, reduced tyre imports from China, heightened demand for PV/CV/tractor tyres, specialized tyres for EVs and rising tyre exports due to anti-dumping duties on Chinese tyres.

In addition, with the global restriction (anti-dumping) on Chinese Carbon black, reduced consumption of Russian Carbon black due to war and regulatory constraints on European and North American production has opened a huge international market demand for PCBL. It now operates in 50+ countries.

Future trends: Over FY23-26E, the sales volumes of rubber black is anticipated to experience a CAGR of 8.5%, In same breath, the volumes of performance black and specialty black are projected to witness a CAGR growth of 17% and 23%.

PCBL is a part of the RP-Sanjeev Goenka Group of Kolkata which operates other listed companies like CESC in power, Spencer in retail shopping, First source which is a BPO, IPL team – Lucknow Giants and others. Most of its companies are AA-rated, so being part of this group gives PCBL a very strong financial flexibility.

While PCBL’s sales volume grew by 19% YoY but the revenue only grew by 2.1% YoY. This happened due to the 15% decline in market prices which was a direct result of oversupply of cheap Russian carbon black before active consumption restraints were placed. EBITDA improved by over 30% due to the rising share of high margin performance and specialty carbon blacks in the overall sales mix. In line, the company profits also increased by 12%.

From an equity research analyst perspective, they are anticipating a 40% upside on the stock with revenue growth of 20% and profit growth of 16% - all bullish on capacity increase and high demand across product lines.

Based on my valuation models (football field with relative, DCF) - the stock is undervalued at the moment by 15% - 20% across the different valuation metrics that you take.

So overall, its an interesting hidden gem that has the potential to grow after the correction is complete.

Please check out the link (6.5 minutes) where I further structure this detail out. Your feedback will help me course correct and increase the depth of my analysis:

"Option Buying is like a Legal Gambling, You Will Lose Your Life Savings + 5 Years of Time"," There are thousands of stories where people lost their life savings in option buying, intraday or High Leverage Trading. and here is why you need to stop it as soon as possible.  


 

https://preview.redd.it/zaimph51yirc1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=364dc28ba1c551852219ea1f32ec7058c93bf110

### Odds Are Against You

In #Optionbuying, it's almost impossible to make money. Option Buying is like legal gambling & odds are against small traders.

You can make it for 6 months but can't sustain it. Ultimately the market will take it back. 

The biggest loss is that you start designing your mindset and psychology in the wrong direction.

For example, you give 2 years to option buying. You will need a further 2 years to unlearn the wrong mental behavior.

**You lose your Life Savings + 4-5 years. The cost is high.**  


&#x200B;

### Why Most Option Buyers Lose their capital?

It's not about strategy or knowledge.#OptionBuying requires you to be right exactly within a specific time period. You are not getting any chance of error in a probabilistic environment.

**It's like walking on a rope**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dc0pkl84yirc1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=b791008d5a7d47d3e3470578c77225ad78f2e363

You lose in #OptionBuying if

1. Prices went in the wrong direction or
2. Price in the right direction but momentum gets slow or
3. Prices are in the right direction but does not reach a certain level till the expiry

So everything should be right to be profitable in option buying.

If you are serious about #StockMarket trading, your main strategy can't be like walking on the rope.

Even professional trainers who can walk on the rope will not do it every day. 

As a trader, the first focus should be to survive so make it simple. Use trading strategies and a time frame that gives you enough room for errors like we do in our trading approach ""[Swing Cash](https://x.com/marketreader_/status/1750203078656319519?s=20)""

 

**Don't treat trading like a lottery.**

**Lotteries are not played with life savings**

Stock Market is designed in a way that you can predict it in a broad way.

If you try to predict every move at every level, probably you will lose trust in your skills & strategy. Design your trading strategy in a way that makes money without being exactly right.

Will share my analysis for index FnO everyday post market closes beginning 26 march 2024.,"Hi, This is my first ever post on reddit and i plan to share my technical analysis and personal opinions everyday, this post will tell you about my trading journey and how i have reached this point as of today.
So i always had an affinity towards the stock markets which got multiplied multifolds when i completed watching the harshad mehta series , now that was 3-4 years ago i started my journey towards learning abt the market then n there but kind of got occupied in ptber stuff and put this relationship at the back burner for a while, now around the last quarter of 2023 my interest peaked again , i decided to go all in , decided will learn everythimg i can about the stock markets i can however long it may take, decided to do paid courses of all the youtubers i admired and began my learning journey with and  i think are genuine and most probably not fraud or show offs, ended up doing 7-8 paid courses of those youtubers , got a solid understanding of the market, played a little with the strategies and setups these guys provided , which tbh are very good but i kinda had an ick to use somebody elses strategy and personally i  always wanted to have my own strategy or say setup which i had built from scratch , so i read say close to 15-20 books combined all my learnings from the youtubers and their courses and these books and came up with roughly 6-7 strategies/setups and decided to work on just 2 now i believe there can never be an end to one's learning , i will always be open to learning new things, concepts , but for now i think i will be working on these 2 strategies which i have made from scratch, strictly backetested it with the data from past 5 years without any bias, the statistics for my strategies are as follows:-
Setup 1)  Total Entries Generated- 1286
                  Total Trades Won-  1089
                   Total SL - 197
                    Winrate - 84.68%
                       Minimum R2R -> 1:2
Haven't really noticed a significant drawdown period as such so kinda ignored it.

Setup 2)  Total entries Generated- 1151
                  Total Trades won - 1079
                   Total SL - 72
                     Winrate - 93.74%
                        Min R2R => 1:2
same case for drawdowns as above.

Ps:- i know the statistics seems crazy but it is what it is atleast on paper and theoretically, it is now upon me to execute it properly and practically and see how it works.

I will be sharing my analyis as well as progress everyday and see how it goes.

How Realistic is Paper Trading for F&O?,"How realistic is Paper Trading compared to Actual Trading for F&O?

I initially wanted to start Trading in F&O last year but decided to try Paper Trading apps for a while so that I could develop and refine my strategies, timing and psychology. I have been Paper Trading for about a year now(started in Apr 2023) and things have been pretty good so far.

I started with a few losses but recovered quickly within two weeks and have been seeing profits consistently since. I averaged a profit of 3-6% per day in the first 2 months. I have been averaging 15-20% per day in the past 3 months and 25-30% per day in the last 30 days. My average loss on a red day was 7.2% for the whole year and about 5% in the past 3 months.

I've learnt many things in the past year, specifically about when to deploy capital and when to sit and watch on the sidelines. I've tried to reduce my losses as much as possible by sticking to a strict strategy and cutting my losses early.

There have also been some days like today (usually expiry days) where i have done 9x and 10x baggers as well.

I was aware that there might be a bit of beginners luck at the start and hence decided to continue for the whole year to see how things go. I uninstalled and reinstalled the paper trading apps and also traded from new accounts multiple times as the capital had gotten obnoxiously high and I wanted to start from a smaller amount again.

Now I'm wondering if I should actually start trading with real money after this year of practice? I know that F&O is a zero-sum game and all the other disclaimers as well as how awry things can go after one bad candle. If I do start, I will start with an amount that I'm ok with losing completely. I also only plan to use a part of the profits I've made from my equity investments to trade in F&O. Should I maybe start with 1 lot and go from there?

I would love to hear advise and experiences from the sub-members especially about how you fared after switching from paper trading apps to real trading. Sorry about the long post and

Should i sell it now? Or can i incur more loss than 10k which i invested selling these?

"Are International Credit Rating Agencies (S&P, Moodys, Fitch) doing more harm than good along the way?","Hi! My first post here so if I'm in the wrong place do let me know! Also is the flair alright?

I was reading about some International Credit Rating Agencies and how they have given the lowest rating possible to India and how the Govt is not pleased with it (understandably). Now I'm a lay person and clueless about how the markets work and all but I do find the Govt's arguments about how the CRAs are unreliable in India's case-

1. Low external debt to GDP ratio (19%)
2. zero sovereign default history
3. 5th largest economy (yup I know inequality exists but still)
4. the fact that CRA's get paid by the debtor parties
5. the govt claims a 'developed country' bias by CRAs where they get good rating in spite of poor macroeconomic health

CRAs are supposed to give investors insights into the entity they're interested to invest and make it easier for them to make investment decisions without having to carry intense research on it (honestly I think that only a lazy investor would base their decisions entirely upon some CRAs rating but I'm just parroting the internet ). But it does seem to be true that a lot of investors invest based upon these ratings. That's where a lot of my concern stems from. Developing countries like China and India are being given poor ratings while they're doing decently macroeconomically. IF these CRAs keep giving them poor rating won't it hurt these nations economically? Or does the wider market really not care about these ratings?

My very limited knowledge on these CRAs have not led me to have a good view on them. A monopoly of just 3 agencies? And based in the West? This might just be my bias acting up but things don't add up here.

Have these agencies been discredited by journalists or press? any scandal of sorts? Or an established body of academic work which heavily disagrees with the CRAs functioning? If the World Bank can have internally fixed ratings whose to say that it doesn't happen in these CRAs?

PS- This post comes from a place of genuine interest and curiosity .Please do be kind to me. I really don't know much so please correct me wherever I'm wrong!

What You check before investing in a stock??"
I'm an undergrad and I want to begin investing :),"Hello! I'm an undergrad in psych (nowhere near finance/eco) but I want to start investing seriously. I have some equity (10k in STLTECH and 13k in UPL (a very small amount ik)) but both are in a loss (which is fine, I'll keep it there till it turns for 15% profit at least I'm thinking) but I kind of need money monthly if possible. I have 5k to spare for investing per month, the rest is to spend on monthly things but slowly I want to make my returns into spending and my actual salary (I have a part-time) into my investment.  


I was thinking of investing in something with monthly payout plans. If I need the extra money I'll use it, if not I'll reinvest it. If I can find a strong promising investing option I don't mind investing more than 5k to use the monthly payout for my expenses. Please suggest some choices and I don't understand investing jargon so please explain as you would to a 3-yr-old. Thank you so much :)


P.S.: I use AngelOne."

This is regarding Dividends,"It's really a noob question but I don't seem to understand the way dividend works, what i thought was the ex-dividend date is the last date to have those company's shares in your demat account if you want the money.

So is there a time limit from the ex dividend date when the dividend are distributed?
