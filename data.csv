1 Trillion Rupees worth without a single product! - Varun Beverages,"
I would like to draw your attention towards the Pepsi’s largest manufacturer and distributor in India - VBL!

Few things to keep in mind:

- With 25+ years of operations, Varun Beverages or VBL is Pepsi’s top 3 franchisees in the world outside US.

- The company operates in three broad segments:

- -Carbonated Soft Drinks which contributes to 71% of the portfolio volume. Products include: soft drinks (e.g., Pepsi 7Up) energy drinks (e.g., Sting), club soda and carbonated juice drinks

- -Non Carbonated beverages which contributes to nearly 25% of the portfolio volume. Products include: fruit-pulp drinks (eg., Tropicana), ice tea (under Lipton brand), sports drinks (e.g., Gatorade), packaged drinking water (e.g., Aquafina) and in-house dairy based drink (under the Creambell brand).

- Food Products. Products include: Kurkure Puffs in India and Lays and Doritos in Africa.

- With BevCo’s acquisition, the firm will get access to four new product lines. Products include: Caffeine drink - Refreshhh, Energy Drink - Reboost, Carbonated Drink - Coo-ee and Alternative Drinks -JiVE

- It has 42 manufacturing facilities (36 in India & 6 in International territories). Also, the firm completed a capacity–driven capex of 2100 cr. in 2023 and has planned for 3600 cr. in 2024 of which 600 cr. is earmarked for international markets. As per the management, with new plants, the revenue potential will double in the coming years.

- In terms of geography, Indian business contributes to 80% of overall sales. Within India, it operates in 27 states and 7 UT. Remaining sales are international, from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Morocco, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

- Varun Beverages is part of the $15B + Jaipuria Group. The group runs the listed firm Devyani International (KFC India, Pizza Hut) and Pearl Drinks, manufacturer of PET bottles. Almost a vertically integrated ecosystem for Pepsi.

- The firm has had a long history with Pepsi. It has grown from 26% contribution to sales in 2011 to 90% contribution in Pepsi sales in 2023. It has the ‘right to manufacturer Pepsi in India’ till 2039 so unlikely to have another firm break this space.

- With over 39 manufacturing facilities, 120 depots, owned fleet of 2500 vehicles, over 2400 primary distributors, 35 lakh outlets and 10 lakh Visi-coolers, VBL’s on ground infrastructure remains a key driver for company’s growth.

- Varun Beverages Limited (VBL) reported a 20% growth in revenue with an 18% volume growth YoY in Q4 CY23. Despite the increase in cost of sugar, the company still ended with improved EBITDA margin. This improvement was due to softening bottling costs and operational efficiencies

- Net debt increased to Rs 4,700 Cr in 2023 from Rs 3,400 Cr in 2022, an increase of 38% due to growth Capex. But, given this is for capacity expansion, the debt is good as long as it can remain controlled. The interest coverage is 11.4x which means firm can pay back interests for this year

- And finally, with my valuation models (both DCF and relative) the stock is highly overvalued so it is not a value play at the moment. However, equity research analysts are claiming a median rise of 1490 (Sharekhan, Motilal, DAM, Nuvama, K.R. Choksey, Indsec and others) with as high as 1732 driven by market growth parameters.

Please check out the link where I further detail this out. Your feedback will help me course correct and increase the depth of my analysis:

I have lost almost 1.8 cr in stock market since 2017 but I am still hopeful ,"I have lost almost 1.8 Crore since 2017... (57 lakh in Bitcoin it was froud with me , rest 1.2 crore or nearby from F&O and stocks). 
Whenever I buy put option the market goes against me if the same day I booked a loss then it will come down ... If I buy a call then the same thing happens. It's been happening for 7 years as of now. Even on 28 March 2024 in the morning I was bearish so the market was almost touched at an all time high and I closed my position in a loss near 3 pm. After I  booked a loss within 5 Min the market came down almost 250 pts in nifty and 400 pts in bank nifty. 
I know it's very high loss , due to this my wife's left me. She filed  divorce case too. Currently I am earning 7-8 lakh from my profession. Right now I have a few lakhs of loans that can be cleared. Right now I have 10 lakh capital in my hand and I know I can get my lost money back from the market, but I don't know how... I know for one thing for sure if the market took my money then the market will give my money back too... But the question is how .. I tried all the ways but every time I failed. I don't want cash based trade in equity because it will take a very long time... If someone who is genuine then I can share my demat so she/he can trade and I will share profit with that person. "
Just Stop!,"Holy shit the number of people who loose money in F&O is crazy high! It's a hedging instrument dum dums not a money printer! I see so many posts some/most of whom are not in great financial positions in life gambling away their or their families money in exchange for fuck all! 

Your life won't change with that 4-5k profit per lot man. That's not what the market is. There are people who win consistently no denying but to be one of them you need to dedicate yourself into understanding a staggering amount of information, coupled with a large experiential exposure to the markets. 

And many of the posts you see on here, who show off their one off 'wins' have just gotten lucky on those specific trades.


Have some sense. Please.

The corpus you have right now is your biggest asset after your time don't piss it away.

16 y/o male. Bad financial condition. Need Advice.,"My father has lost approx 2.5cr in the last 5 years from FnO trading and currently has very little money, no savings. The only savings are with my mother, around 30 lakhs or so. Both do not have a job at the moment, and for the forseeable future. Father is going to go to real estate work as he has some experience in that.

Apart from my father losing all that money, he also has taken personal loans of around 20 lakhs without informing anyone. He is paying interest + principle 1L/month. But with his current bank balance, it seems he will have to take my mother’s money to pay after a few months.

I’m 16 years old, in 12th grade, and really want to support my family. I wouldn’t make this post if things were okay but my parents have told me a lot about the situation and things are dire. I am financially inclined and have been reading Varsity to gain knowledge. I don’t know what to do. Is there any way I can support my family? Or is there any way my father can get out of his debt trap and the situation can get better? Please help."

Upstox ruined my ELSS Investments,"I need suggestions. I also posted this on another sub, Mutual Funds India. 

I invested 1.3 L in ELSS Mutual Funds on 22-03-2024 at ~8.00 PM for Tax Savings this year in selective 5 funds using Upstox. 
As we all know this date won't be counted, as the cut off time for Mutual Funds transactions are 3 PM. The next 3 days are non-business days i.e. Saturday, Sunday and Monday as it was Holi. Now comes Tuesday, 26-03-2024 I receive a message from Upstox regarding my orders for Quant ELSS Tax Saver that it has been ""Placed"" and no updates for other funds. I called Upstox to know about my other investments, they told me to wait for T+2 days before reaching them. Mind you I have received no communication or status of orders from the app. It is usually says ""In process. Units to be credited to portfolio"" from day one for all the funds. It is even the same status at the time of this writing. 

I waited for updates the next 2 days. Created several tickets and emailed them, but they never once reached out to me or updated me about the order statuses. My portfolio for Quant was however, was moving forward with updates from the AMC (Quant) themselves using messages. 

Today at 10PM, the last business day of this financial year I am seeing my funds being credited back to my account except the quants. None of my investment orders were placed. Upstox didn't even update me. This will lose me a lot of money.

Just to give the context, I invest 1L for my GF as well on 23-03-2024 Saturday at ~8 PM. She received all of her funds on time by 27-03-2024. Only difference is that hers was through Groww app. Same funds. 

Can I do something do something about this? I am really disheartened. Upstox didn't communicate or replied to my emails or tickets. Their customer service is pathetic, they are 9 out of 10 times are unreachable and that one time, they will keep telling to wait for T+3 days before any updates. The orders are still in process, with status ""They have sent this order to exchanges"". Can I sue them? Can complain to SEBI? Can they be held responsible for anything ? "

More precisely I was looking if it is good time to invest in these stocks before election, What I think rn is that markets has already predicted stable govt after 2024 Lok Sabha elections, that is what reflecting in these high gains numbers, but not to say, there is an opportunity of some gains in these stocks because of elections.

Not to mention, a large stock price correction is possible if there is a change in government or if margin with opposition is small in number of seats vote etc."

KPI Green can see a growth of around 50-80% within or after Q4 Declaration of result.,"So I usually  don't like to share name of my holding company but this is more of Estimate I have done on my own just to see whether I am right or wrong

KPI Green is in Solar industry and have seen huge boom in recent years   


***Not to mention This is also summer stock and anticipation of high electricity(& Increase in price ) in this season all power co.  including KPI will Probably be benefited from it,  excess Energy could be sold to co. like Power Co. for them to supply nonstop electricity .***    

KPI is currently at 67 PE

The calculation is made on estimate that PE remain constant (which is reasonable to assume because of the GrowthRate it could contract if the bear market starts and considering the time frame its less likely)

In 9M company energized 380Mw (141MW IPP + 239MW CPP) which resulted in 737+ Cr Revenue in 9M

Now for Q4 as per the interview of promoter Company energized 445MW which Includes 161MW IPP(which he told), **That means** 284 MW CPP they also provide Hybrid Power but including that will make calculation more complicated (and hybrid is also little component of their revenue)

After analyzing the previous 3 Q Investor presentation

&#x200B;

|Q|Total Revenue|IPP-Mw|IPP rev.|IPP Rev/Mw|CPP-MW|CPP rev.|CPP rev./MW|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Q1|190|141|41.8|0.29645|198|148.2|.7484848|

|Q+1 Q+2 Q+3|737|141|56.27|.399078014|239|274.73|1.149497|

&#x200B;

Only problem this is The rev/Mw is increasing And I don't know why, so this Lead to 3 Possibility for Q4 revenue

Good	Q4	        MW	Rs/MW (Avg.)	                       Total revenue

|Q4|MW|RS/MW (AVG.)|Total revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|IPP|161|0.32375|52.125|
|CPP|284|0.92066|261.4677009|
|||**Q4 REVENUE**|**313.592878**|

&#x200B;

**Better**

|Q4|MW|RS/MW (= to last Q3)|Total revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|IPP|161|0.399078014|64.25156028|
|CPP|284|1.149497908|326.4574059|
|||**Q4 Revenue**|**390.7089661**|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Q4|MW|RS/MW (Increase in growth)|Total revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|IPP|161|0.44|70.84|
|CPP|284|1.303|370.052|
|||**Q4 Revenue**|**440.892**|

&#x200B;

SO this would make the revenue for the year (Considering PY revenue was 647 & REVENUE In 9M is 737 cr.)

Rate of growth in revenue **YoY**

|Scenario|Revenue for the year|Rate of YOY|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Good|1050.5928|62.38%|
|Better|1127.7089|74.30%|
|Best|1178.127|82.09%|

&#x200B;

**TLDR : COULD BUY KPI FOR LONG TERM & SHORT TERM GAIN**

Edit: Stupid reddit changed the entire spacing

Got lucky today with Gravita India,"I bought Gravita in December last year at a price of 1105 of around 2 Lakhs. Stock goes into downtrend. I averaged it slowly and my average price reduced to 1032 of around 3 Lakhs. This is a big amount for my portfolio. The stock price touched 730 a couple of weeks ago so I was in big loss.

I don't know what happened but the stock started recovering and yesterday it touched my resistance and closed below it.  It was still 10% less than my price but I decided to book loss. I called my friend and said that I will sell this stock in the morning when the market opens.

Today I woke up late at 9.30. I saw huge gains in my portfolio and noticed Gravita was up by 12%. Price was around 1040. I sold at market price and it was sold at 1036. Since then stock price reduced by 5%. I got extremely lucky today as I sold it on top. I would have sold it yesterday also but I was not watching the market.

I have read these type of incidents on this sub and always wondered when will this happen to me. It happened with me today. I didn't make any profit but I was able to exit from a stock without making the loss. "
Is is advisable to invest in PPF in Todays age ?,"I am 36 years old and in the last 7  financial years,  i have invested about 10.35 lakhs in PPF which has become about 13.6 lakhs. I have been investing in stocks since about 7 months and Mutual Funds for about 2 years. They are giving me better returns for now. Now time has come to invest the 1.5 Lakh in PPF. I am wondering is if it us worth it to get the 7.1% tax free  return, or should i just invest the minimum investment to keep account active and continue investing in equities?"
Lost 50k.,"Tried fno on and off since last 6 months. Was breaking even trading fno early on, later made a big loss of 20 k in one session, put a bigger bet that day and recovered loss. This made me bet more over next few days and lost 50 k. Vowed not to trade ever again. But after a few days bought cheap options and lost 3-4k. The best thing I did now was to mail groww to disable fno. I dont trade now. Addiction is real and insidious. I would advise beginners like me to use only a fixed amount per month for trading in a seperate account. And never break that rule for greed or to breakeven your losses. If option trading is still profitable for you then its a win. If you cant control this then stop early before you lose an amount that hurts and losses seem unrecoverable."
If this growth real or just like feeding a sacrificial lamb 🙂,"I don't if there is any market news or not which made market ho high .... But I have a feeling that the market will go high for some days to book the maximum profit by fis' or dis' and then the blood bath of correction will start from April till the end of election? 
It's like a trap I guess 
Please tell your thoughts or this 
As I am a newbie so please use easy language to make me understand my wrong statements if any....😀"

 India’s booming market for exchange-traded currency derivatives is headed for a sudden demise.  


A new rule set to take effect on April 5 is expected to force out most of the market’s most active players, drying up volumes that reached $5 billion-a-day.  


 Brokerages have started asking clients to close out contracts after exchanges on Monday reaffirmed the ruling from the central bank that participants must have an actual foreign-exchange exposure. That rules out individual traders and speculators who comprise a large portion of the volume.

How do you guys buy when market is mostly up?,"I have started investing in equity since last 7.5 months and I’m sitting at a profit of ~21%. Till now, I have invested ~20L. 

It was easier for me to put more money whenever the market went down. These days it’s mostly going up and I’m not able to gather enough confidence in putting more money into stocks that have given me good profit. 

Shall I hold my money till after the elections or invest anyway as in long term it won’t matter much?"

* Max. Possible Return (Theoretically) = 18.25%
* % of move Captured = 51% ( this happens in volatile market)  


I was consistently doing this type of “Showing in Public” experiment in earlier months of 2023 & 2022 and in 2024, we started again on 12th March  


 

### Yes! Cash Trading Can Make You Rich

Majority believes that you can’t make high returns in Cash trading while reality is that everyone is losing in F&O or Intraday.  


The purpose of these experiments is to change the mindset of traders. Its possible to 100X your capital 7-8 years with just 6% per month. (do the compounding math)

Making extraordinary returns in Cash trading requires real skills because you are not taking any leverage & you have to follow the right process.  


## How we can generate High Returns in Cash Trading

So for Swing Trading, I have a detailed process, framework & blueprint for every aspect. Here is our **Swing Cash Trading Framework:**  


* **Stock Selection Framework:** Research Combining Technical with Fundamentals
* **Timing Framework: Levels, Demand-Supply Study, Entry, Risk-Reward**
* **Trade Management:** Managing Trades by Assessing Risk-Reward at every point
* **EXIT Framework:** Deciding exits & optimizing overall worst case scenario
* **Risk Management:** Optimizing ROI & reducing losses in different market cycles
* **Psychology:** Mental Models to approach the market in right manner  


 

### How We Traded in March: Key Mistakes & Learnings:

#### Midcap & Small Cap Fall & Our View got Exactly right

So from last week of February, we started getting signs of top formation in Small & midcap stocks. I had posted multiple times about the possible correction on twitter & tg  


Our own portfolio swing setups were started failing which was first sign thereafter Small Cap Index was showing top formation patterns.  


Posted on 13th March about the 13500 zone in Small Cap-250 index may act as support area:

Nifty Small Cap 250 Index took exact support in 13500 zone Here is the chart of Small Cap 250 Index:

https://preview.redd.it/85wwzsazctrc1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=169cbed34581883de569d1bbe8e6aaaf1e68e354

&#x200B;

 So the first thing we got right was Market View and this happens because of our consistent tracking & skill in finding right demand-supply areas *(we have dedicated framework on LEVELS)*  


#### MISTAKES

So despite our right analysis on markets, we have done a few mistakes on 12 & 13th March:

**REDTAPE & RATEGAIN:**  


We started adding these 2 stocks early on 12 & 13th March before the market bottom based on individual stock support areas while market was still falling.   


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6w0axfn4dtrc1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffc8b6752b091524fb6dd86c9fbe7ca8f0a95a2

 Now 12 & 13th March was the Panic days and in panic, even a strong stock can remain irrational & break the immediate support.  


**ACE**  


We added ACE on 13th March as it was our rocket stock earlier but it broke our SL levels on same day & we exited to reduce risk. 

https://preview.redd.it/ifa6p0z8dtrc1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5db1ad63920f2462eea08193497a84a44e5af22

   
Next day ACE was up by 20% (ACE could have been our biggest winner). The market volatility & panic forced us to exit the position  


**Indus Tower**  


We picked Indus at lowest point and after buying it was up 3-4% for next 6 days but suddenly due to some news, I exited on 7th day as market was little volatile and I had to reduce risk.   


https://preview.redd.it/bfy2xolddtrc1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=22af0276e4193db74c5a4b9baa702d1c815548a7

 I exited Indus in 2.5% loss thereafter its up by 20-25%

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** We have done 2 big blunder and lost 20% + moves in ACE & INDUS Tower. Our Portfolio Return could have been more than 15% if we managed to take rational decision.  


Despite that mistakes, we were able to generate 9.3% because our system provides enough **“ROOM for ERROR”**  


***As a human , we can’t avoid mistakes. Room for error is very important in your trading approach.***  


***If your system provides an edge with enough room for error, you will win in the long run.***  


#### March Learnings:

1. Market can remain irrational in panic, wait for it to settle  


2. If entry is wrong, exit can't go right  


3. Don't focus on news. Price is the ultimate indicator  


**4. Keep adding winners, cutting losers**"
Intrinsic Value Calculator,"**Intrinsic Value** is created by Benjamin Graham the Guru of Warren Buffett in his book Intelligent Investor.  The formula is helpful in Evaluating stocks which have projected growth rate.

Intrinsic Value helps to find the Current Value of the stock after Calculating the EPS Growth for next N years.  This is a Moving Calculation!

To calculate Intrinsic Value you require the following:

* EPS – Earnings Per Share (eg: 50)
* G – Growth Rate for next 10 years (eg: 20%)
* Y – No-Risk FD Returns (eg: 10%)

**Note**: The No-Risk FD Returns shows the Alternative Investment Opportunity

Stock in holding is showing inactive since 4/5 months.,"I have been holding around 15,000 shares of  jbf industries for more then a year now , the stock is showing inactive since the last 4/5 months. What can i do about it? I have never faced this before."

AU SMALL FINANCE BANK THE NEXT MULTI BAGGER ?,So according to me the entire private banking sector of india is undervalued . this is because of high interest rate the NPA of bank have increased by quite a lot . this has made private bank a bit less lucrative  to invest in . so banks life HDFC will give u a return of at least 20 percent within a year . but i want more so i have invest a good 8 percent of my portfolio in AU SMALL FINANCE BANK which can be a multi bagger because it has high growth and  the  market cap is also very low . WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS . i have a combined 40 percent of my portfolios in private bank and waiting for interest cuts 
How to Trade Peacefully with Low Risk,"How to genrate high returns without F&O, Intraday or Leverage & what if you don't need to watch prices all the day.

The answer is Swing Trading in Rocket Stocks in Cash Segment.

In the Stock Market, there are always a few [Rocket Stocks](https://marketreader.substack.com/p/focus-on-top-1-stocks) that are moving like a rocket. Let’s look at some data points of the Indian Stock Market:  
  
**Total Listed Companies:** 4500-5000  
  
**Companies with a Market Cap above 500 Crore:** 1500-200

* **100%+ Returns Over 1 Year:** 531 Companies (30-35%)
* **200%+ Returns Over 1 Year:** 182 Companies (10-12%)
* **300%+ Returns Over 1 Year:** 85 Companies (5-6%)
* **Nifty Returns Over 1 Year:** 22-23%

*(Data source: Screener.in)*

We have seen a superb bull run in the last 1 year, so these are not the usual data. But the point here is that there are always a few stocks that are running on steroids.

  
**Let’s look at the data of the last 3 months:**

* Nifty 3M Return: 11-12%
* Nifty Midcap 3M Return: 17-18%
* Nifty Smallcap 3 M Return: 16-17%

***Out of total 1668 Companies (Above 500 Crore MCap), 44 Companies have given 100% + return in the last 3 Months.***  
  
*So here 2.6% of companies have given an extraordinary return (6X Return compared to the index). These are the* ***Rocket Stocks*** *that will create wealth for you.*  


So how we trade in these Rocket stocks. Let's discuss the Swing Cash Model:

  
**Swing Cash (A Peaceful Trading System)**  
  
→ In Swing Cash, we try to find stocks that have the potential to give big returns (like 12-25%) in 2-4 weeks.  
  
→ At a time we hold 5-6 Stocks with 16-25% allocation.   
  
→ The average SL is around 3-5% and the normal RR is 1:3  
  
→ Based on Historical data, 80-85% of the time, the market is tradable and rest 20% of the time we sit on Cash  
  
→ Out of 12 months, 8-10 months are usually profitable.   
  
→ The average holding time is 2 weeks so usually the Swing portfolio gets rotated in every 2 week  
  
→ Out of 5-6 Stocks, 2-3 became super performers and an average portfolio may get 2-4% return in 2 weeks  
  
→If you get 5-6% monthly ROI, usually you can double your capital every year  
  
→ You need 7 doubles to grow your capital by 100x. So in 7 years, 1 lakh can become 1 Crore  
  
The best part is that it is all possible without F&O, Intraday, or without taking any leverage.

  
**Practical Experiement of Swing Cash:**

So we are doing successful swing trading in last 2 years. To show that its possible to generate high ROI in cash segment we have done a show in public experiment.

In this experiement, every entry & exit decision was shared in advance on twitter.

In this experiment, we generated 12.76% ROI in last 20-22 days and everything was shared in advance.

https://preview.redd.it/rnx59zjjf3sc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e14a8a15fd9a92af4edcc3141105813ee8017d61

Here the interesting data from these Swing Cash Trades in Last 20 Days:  
  
Portfolio Return: +12.76%  
  
Capital Allocation: 20% per Trade ( max 5 holdings at a time)  
  
Total Trades: 9  
  
Winners: 5  
  
Losers: 4  
  
Average Winner: 14.88%  
  
Average Loser: -2.13%  
  
Average Holding Period: 10-12 Days (7-8 Trading days)"

My 1 year of trading journey,"Yep, this day marks my 1 year trading anniversary, yayyy! I've made many mistakes, learned from those mistakes, made new mistakes everytime, learned the importance of discipline, psychology, money management also with trading.
 Financially speaking I'm breakeven with whatever the capital I had so I'm happy. Now I have experience and capital so looking forward to learn new lessons and techniques.
Summarising my trading journey I started with option buying with a capital of 15k, made profit of 13k then had to take break because of exams, then came back lost nearly 17k then shifted towards option selling/hedging. Dabbled a bit and incurred an additional 5k loss. I was sad, upset, not feeling good but kept on following rules, sticked to that one strategy, developed some discipline and recovered the loss within these 3 months. So now, I'm breakeven, with a good knowledge, willing to learn more in this next accounting year(and hopefully earn hehe) 
I also tried everything like Positional, Intraday, Swing and what not in stocks as well as derivatives. Got to know my core strength area and now sticking to that. 
Any bits of advice is appreciated:)"

I've been thinking of investing now since I have a stable job and earning avg amount. What I am thinking now is to put my current savings as FD and start investing from what I earn now. So something like 1.25L to FD for 1 year 3 months at 7.1% interest and reinvest it. Is that a good idea?   
  
Also I've been thinking to have a RD of 5k/m as an emergency amount for same amount of time and interest which would yield around 78k after 1 year 3 months. Then reinvest this amount as FD along with whatever the amount I get from above FD.

Is this at all a good idea? Finance makes no sense to me tbh."

I've tried trading before, but I lost about 1.5 lakhs. And when I've bought stocks, I've ended up selling too soon and missing out on profits. So, I'm considering a systematic investment plan (SIP) where I invest regularly and forget about it for 10 years.

At first, I thought about mutual funds (MFs), but a friend said exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might be better because they have lower expense ratios. However, when I checked, MFs have actually been doing better than ETFs for the past five years irrespective of the high expense ratios.

My colleagues suggested direct stock investment, but then my model portfolio of 20 stocks I was planning to SIP was also beaten by the MFs. 

I feel the MFs are superior in every way but still both my friend and colleagues are not convinced. Am I missing something here?

Bank Nifty Prediction for 02 April 2024," 

Today, the Bank Nifty opened with a 200-point gap up, reaching a high of 47625 before moving sideways for the rest of the day.

When the Bank Nifty opens with a gap up and trades sideways throughout the day, it often signals bullish sentiment for the next day.

* We can observe that sellers around the **47500** mark are at risk of being **trapped**.
* There might be a correction to fill the gap upto 47180, but it doesn’t present a selling opportunity.
* Instead, we should look for **long trade opportunities** above 47625, possibly targeting 48000.

**For tomorrow’s trading session,**

* any opportunity above 47625 would be a great long trade with a stop loss at 47455.
* If the Bank Nifty opens with a gap down, it’s advisable to wait for some time as it may fill the gap down to 47180, Once it starts trading below 47385.
* another long trade can be considered with a target of 47775 around 47180.
* Avoid trading in the range of **47460-47590**.
* The downside is only possible **below 46860**, so it’s better to focus on finding **long-side trades for tomorrow**.

*Disclaimer: We advise you to check with certified experts before making any Investment or Trading decision based on “Bank Nifty prediction”*"
Aavas Financiers,"Currently, fundamentals look stronger than ever though the Long term borrowing has jumped quite a bit but, the company is managing to record consistent & decent increase in Revenue and PAT, however, the promotor has been selling their stakes every quarter. 

If we look at the technicals then you'll notice that the stock has been on a downtrend since past 2 years now and has broken the  support of 1337 and heading towards 1273 which seems like the last support level before the stock drowns below 1000.

I'm planning to build some position in this at around 1280.

For people investing for long term what are your goals?,What you think you ultimate goal is by leaving a stock for 10-15 years or more. After that will you sell that stock? Or keep holding it because it gave you good return. I really want to understand someone’s perspective on this.

# FPIs to lead the next leg of the rally?

Highlights

* FPI holding in Indian equities has touched a decade-low
* The gap between domestic investors and FPIs has been reduced to a record low
* The impact of FPI exits on the Indian market has come down
* Domestic investment has cushioned FPI exit

Not too long ago, FPI investors were considered smart money. Their movement would decide the market's trend. But this no longer seems to be the case."

nifty smallcap 100 vs nifty smallcap 250,I want to open a sip for small cap index for 10 years. Which smallcap index  one should choose? Please provide your reasoning as well so that it can help me in critical thinking.
Is this diversification good for Mutual Funds Investment?,"I (23M) am going to invest it for long term (10+ years). I am doing monthly SIP of 30k every month and dividing it as below.

1. Quant Small Cap (2.5k)
2. Tata Small Cap (5k)
3. Quant Large Cap (2.5k)
4. Nippon India Large Cap (5k)
5. Quant Flexi Cap (5k)
6. HDFC Gold (5k)
7. Nippon India Gold (5k)

I am planning I'll withdraw from gold and invest in all the other 5 funds equally (or maybe a bit more in small caps, depends...) when market corrects. Basically I came up with this diversification from the fact that, I decided to invest 7.5k in small caps, 7.5k in large caps, 5k in flexi cap and 10k in gold. And then divided each (except flexi) in 2 AMCs based on their holdings. Let me know if I am doing the right thing, or something needs to be changed."
Starting SIPs in Mutual funds for dad,"So i(19M) have convinced my dad to start doing monthly SIP of 5k in mutual funds. I've explained to him that he'll have to continue it for atleast 5-7 years to see the results and he has agreed. 
Thinking of choosing 3 mutuals funds
1. nifty 50 index fund-2k
2. parag parikh flexi cap fund-2k
3. Quant small cap fund- 1k(after initial 5k investment)

is there anything i should change?"
"Option Buying is like a Legal Gambling, You Will Lose Your Life Savings + 5 Years of Time"," There are thousands of stories where people lost their life savings in option buying, intraday or High Leverage Trading. and here is why you need to stop it as soon as possible.  


 

https://preview.redd.it/zaimph51yirc1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=364dc28ba1c551852219ea1f32ec7058c93bf110

### Odds Are Against You

In #Optionbuying, it's almost impossible to make money. Option Buying is like legal gambling & odds are against small traders.

You can make it for 6 months but can't sustain it. Ultimately the market will take it back. 

The biggest loss is that you start designing your mindset and psychology in the wrong direction.

For example, you give 2 years to option buying. You will need a further 2 years to unlearn the wrong mental behavior.

**You lose your Life Savings + 4-5 years. The cost is high.**  


&#x200B;

### Why Most Option Buyers Lose their capital?

It's not about strategy or knowledge.#OptionBuying requires you to be right exactly within a specific time period. You are not getting any chance of error in a probabilistic environment.

**It's like walking on a rope**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dc0pkl84yirc1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=b791008d5a7d47d3e3470578c77225ad78f2e363

You lose in #OptionBuying if

1. Prices went in the wrong direction or
2. Price in the right direction but momentum gets slow or
3. Prices are in the right direction but does not reach a certain level till the expiry

So everything should be right to be profitable in option buying.

If you are serious about #StockMarket trading, your main strategy can't be like walking on the rope.

Even professional trainers who can walk on the rope will not do it every day. 

As a trader, the first focus should be to survive so make it simple. Use trading strategies and a time frame that gives you enough room for errors like we do in our trading approach ""[Swing Cash](https://x.com/marketreader_/status/1750203078656319519?s=20)""

 

**Don't treat trading like a lottery.**

**Lotteries are not played with life savings**

Stock Market is designed in a way that you can predict it in a broad way.

If you try to predict every move at every level, probably you will lose trust in your skills & strategy. Design your trading strategy in a way that makes money without being exactly right.

Binance Method $1000 per week,"Hi, I want to share with you a Binance method that I found on the vastness of Facebook. I have done arbitrage before and quite successfully, but this method broke all records regarding the daily spread.

I am not forcing anyone to use it! Rather, I want to show by the example of this method how you can make money in crypto.

I used a capital of **800$** and in a day I earned about **300$ in 24h of work.** I would not say that the work is the most fun, but with such a spread why not.

So, the method itself (I'll simplify it a bit. If you need the full tutorial, I can send to **PM**)

In short, we will earn 0.25-0.5% for each transaction to the IOST network. For this we will use their coin IOST.

**Steps:**

1. Buy a **IOST coin**
2. Then go to **Wallet, Spot** and select the purchased **IOST**
3. Select **Deposit** and **copy MEMO** (It's important to specify every time)
4. Go back and select **Withdraw**
5. Enter the blockchain address **iostcold**
6. Enter the copied MEMO
7. Choose a small amount of coins for the test
8. And after 5-10 minutes we get the amount sent, but only +0.25-0.5% (in coins)

If anyone has been helped, you can throw me a couple bucks for coffee)"

"Are International Credit Rating Agencies (S&P, Moodys, Fitch) doing more harm than good along the way?","Hi! My first post here so if I'm in the wrong place do let me know! Also is the flair alright?

I was reading about some International Credit Rating Agencies and how they have given the lowest rating possible to India and how the Govt is not pleased with it (understandably). Now I'm a lay person and clueless about how the markets work and all but I do find the Govt's arguments about how the CRAs are unreliable in India's case-

1. Low external debt to GDP ratio (19%)
2. zero sovereign default history
3. 5th largest economy (yup I know inequality exists but still)
4. the fact that CRA's get paid by the debtor parties
5. the govt claims a 'developed country' bias by CRAs where they get good rating in spite of poor macroeconomic health

CRAs are supposed to give investors insights into the entity they're interested to invest and make it easier for them to make investment decisions without having to carry intense research on it (honestly I think that only a lazy investor would base their decisions entirely upon some CRAs rating but I'm just parroting the internet ). But it does seem to be true that a lot of investors invest based upon these ratings. That's where a lot of my concern stems from. Developing countries like China and India are being given poor ratings while they're doing decently macroeconomically. IF these CRAs keep giving them poor rating won't it hurt these nations economically? Or does the wider market really not care about these ratings?

My very limited knowledge on these CRAs have not led me to have a good view on them. A monopoly of just 3 agencies? And based in the West? This might just be my bias acting up but things don't add up here.

Have these agencies been discredited by journalists or press? any scandal of sorts? Or an established body of academic work which heavily disagrees with the CRAs functioning? If the World Bank can have internally fixed ratings whose to say that it doesn't happen in these CRAs?

PS- This post comes from a place of genuine interest and curiosity .Please do be kind to me. I really don't know much so please correct me wherever I'm wrong!

How to Find Multibagger Stocks,"Let's discuss how to find stocks that have the potential to compound the capital by 3X, 5X or 10X in 3-5 years.  


https://preview.redd.it/z91lcvqmverc1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=7400ce0207b933cc4781450d3d5f50caca7fccc8

Here is what I look for :  


 **Fundamental Signs**

→ Aggressive Sales Growth

→ Margin Sustainability/Expansion

→ Aggressive EPS Growth

→ Room for PE Expansion

→Low Debt/Debt Free

→Relatively Young Company

→Loss to Profit Shift ( past example: Zomato, Policybazaa. Now delhivery may be next candidate.)

  
**Technical Sign**

Do the bigger picture analysis and stage analysis. Stock should be in uptrend & Stage-2. Basically see whether majority of the last 1 year buyers are in profit or loss.   


Stage Analysis Example (see on my twitter for more example):

https://preview.redd.it/z8qkbdt8verc1.png?width=1505&format=png&auto=webp&s=893c9911f2009e551e3267c59f5dcc1cc3be0358

 ***Look for stocks where the price is not able to catch earning growth.*** *Check case studies of* the *Apar Industry, KPIT etc.*   


***PE Expansion Potential:***

*Just compare Market Cap, Sales, OPM, ROCE, Sales Growth data of the company with similar company in same industry.*

I'm an undergrad and I want to begin investing :),"Hello! I'm an undergrad in psych (nowhere near finance/eco) but I want to start investing seriously. I have some equity (10k in STLTECH and 13k in UPL (a very small amount ik)) but both are in a loss (which is fine, I'll keep it there till it turns for 15% profit at least I'm thinking) but I kind of need money monthly if possible. I have 5k to spare for investing per month, the rest is to spend on monthly things but slowly I want to make my returns into spending and my actual salary (I have a part-time) into my investment.  


I was thinking of investing in something with monthly payout plans. If I need the extra money I'll use it, if not I'll reinvest it. If I can find a strong promising investing option I don't mind investing more than 5k to use the monthly payout for my expenses. Please suggest some choices and I don't understand investing jargon so please explain as you would to a 3-yr-old. Thank you so much :)

Reliance Power clearing off debt?,"Some senior official claimed that it'll be debt free by the end of fiscal year. Is this an overstatement?

Second order thinking is required while analysing a sector/company!!,"
Let’s start with a legend. It goes like this -
British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.


Suppose if there’s a sector which is growing and you invest in a small cap company in that sector thinking that company will become large cap someday just because it’s in growing sector. But, you forgot to do second order thinking. If sector is growing, it will also attract big players with huge money as well. Competition will also increase. Will your small cap company be able survive the competition? Does it have enough money to beat competition? How much is barrier to entry in this business? 

This is why second order thinking is important.
